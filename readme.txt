I am taking CEEN 514 under your recommendation. You explained how it will help me with work at the hydroinformatics lab. 
So far I have enjoyed the class and have been able to pull my work experiance to what I am learning. The app formation process
coinsides a large part with creating a website. Instead of learning these topics at work, I hope that this class will help 
me understand why they are done as opposed to other options. In other words I hope that this class helps me build a larger 
picture in creating web apps. I also feel by learning this process I will be better able to understand and communicate better
with people with a strong computer science background.


Some notes on our project:

Jeff scheduled a meeting with Dr. Franke to get his input of what geoprocessing calculations he wanted, but due to an 
emergancy, Dr. Franke canceled last minute. We are currently leaning on greating a density map that will recalculate each 
time new data is added.
